    "Diabetes is, unfortunately, on the rise in the world.  The number of cases of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has continually gone up since the we have begun to keep track (REF BOOK).  A diabetic is an individual that has lost some (T2D) or all (T1D) of their function islet cells in their pancreas that produce insulin and read BG levels in the blood stream.  Therefore, diabetics must monitor their BG by either drawing blood from their finger and placing that blood on a test strip for a machine to calculate the BG level.  The second way is to use a CGM.  This is a catheter device that is inserted under the skin in the interstitial fluid and can read a diabetics BG every 5 minutes and output it to a device or your phone.  The CGM is a magnificent device that helps diabetes see patterns and trends in their data.  With this data (both forms), a diabetic must determine if their BG is high or low and correct their BG by decreasing the BG with insulin or increasing the BG with carbs.  A lot of diabetics control their insulin intake with an insulin pump.  An insulin pump is catheter device that mechanical supplies insulin to the user through a set of pre-programmed and instant programming settings.  This device is used to simulate the insulin production of the body that diabetics cannot accomplish anymore.  As it can be seen from my description above, life as a diabetic can feel like an eternal game of seesaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a T1D and have been since 1988.  The medical field has done some amazing things to help me have a healthy life, but it is still extremely hard to maintain a healthy BG.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) (REF) decided to put more funding into hard and software that could help diabetics like myself.  This project is called the Artificial Pancreas (AP) project.  The goal is find a close loop system that can measure the BG with a CGM and output the correct amount of insulin from an insulin pump.    This AP project is currently being worked on by some amazing groups (TypeZero, Medtronic, BigFoot Biomedical, Beta Biomedical).  These companies are writing algorithms to have the CGM and insulin pumps communicate so the BG can be regulated continuous throughout the day.  In a landmark move, Medtronic as produced the first ever FDA approved AP this year (DATE).\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is amazing and very important to me.  However, as an engineer for over 10 years, I find comfort in redundancy.  Therefore, I am looking at my diabetic data in a completely different way to hopefully can use in the next generation of APs.\n",

    "It is worth noting that I used the StratifiedShuffleSplit cross-validation generator. This was done because we are dealing with an unbalanced dataset. Our target row has 67% of students passing and 33% failing. Therefore the StratisfiedShuffleSplit was used because it creates splits by preserving the same percentage for each target class as in the complete set. - See ref: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html"
